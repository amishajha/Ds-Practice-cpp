// Input: initialEnergy = 5, initialExperience = 3, energy = [1,4,3,2], experience = [2,6,3,1]
// Output: 8
// Explanation: You can increase your energy to 11 after 6 hours of training, and your experience to 5 after 2 hours of training.
// You face the opponents in the following order:
// - You have more energy and experience than the 0th opponent so you win.
//   Your energy becomes 11 - 1 = 10, and your experience becomes 5 + 2 = 7.
// - You have more energy and experience than the 1st opponent so you win.
//   Your energy becomes 10 - 4 = 6, and your experience becomes 7 + 6 = 13.
// - You have more energy and experience than the 2nd opponent so you win.
//   Your energy becomes 6 - 3 = 3, and your experience becomes 13 + 3 = 16.
// - You have more energy and experience than the 3rd opponent so you win.
//   Your energy becomes 3 - 2 = 1, and your experience becomes 16 + 1 = 17.
// You did a total of 6 + 2 = 8 hours of training before the competition, so we return 8.
// It can be proven that no smaller answer exists
